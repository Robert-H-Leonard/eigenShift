# Why does this package exist? ##

## What is EigenLayer ###
EigenLayer is a protocol on Ethereum that introduces restaking, allowing stakers to reuse their staked ETH or Liquid Staking Tokens (LST) to secure additional applications and earn rewards. It enables pooled security by letting stakers delegate their ETH to operators who run validation services for Actively Validated Services (AVSs). This approach reduces capital costs and enhances trust for decentralized services by leveraging Ethereum's shared security.

## Centralization issues for AVS Developers ###
In the context of Actively Validated Services (AVS) on the EigenLayer protocol, EigenLayer's sdk does not  currently support a consensus mechanism for operators to act as Aggregators for a task. Instead AVS developers must build manual interventions or  centralized entities to manage task assignments, which can introduce points of failure and reduce trust in the network.

## How does EigenShift solve this? ###

The EigenShift Protocol wraps around the [raft consensus protocol](https://github.com/hashicorp/raft), enabling operators to act as Aggregators and provides a trustless, programmatic framework to allow developers to define how task are created, processed and submitted on-chain. This package leverages Raft for leader election between operators to elect Aggregators, tailored to handle EigenLayer tasks and operator BLS signatures. This package also provides a mechanism for AVS developers to design how their AVS rotates Aggregators, and ensures consistent, reliable task validation and submission, enhancing the robustness and security of AVS deployments.

Thanks to using Go generics this package only has 3 external dependencies and provides developers with a framework to define their custom operator consesus:

- EigenLayer's go sdk: https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigensdk-go
- Go ethereum: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
- Raft Protocol Implementation: https://github.com/hashicorp/raft

## Example AVS using this protocol

### Price Oracle AVS Example

To demonstrate how to use this protocol we created a demo price oracle AVS that aggregates price feed data from multiple trusted on-chain oracle networks (such as chainlink) and allows other contracts to consume that aggregated price feed data.

The EigenShift Protocol is used to manage the automatic and trustless rotation of Operators acting as task Aggregators. 

Here's how it is integrated:

- Leader Election (Aggregator assignment) and Task Submission: The protocol utilizes Raft to elect a new leader for each task. Every 15 seconds, a task is generated by the current leader operator, and a new operator is elected as the leader upon task submission.

- Operator Setup: The operators are configured to automatically register and join the existing cluster of operators on startup, ensuring they can participate in the consensus protocol.

This ensures a robust, decentralized process for task aggregation in the AVS. Check it out here:

## Why pick the raft protocol for consensus?
Several companies use the Raft protocol for maintaining consensus in distributed systems:

1. **HashiCorp**: Raft is integral to several [HashiCorp products](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/distributed-consensus-hashicorp-raft) such as Consul, Nomad, and Vault. These tools rely on Raft to manage leader elections, log replication, and ensuring consistency across nodes in a distributed system.

2. **Apache Kafka**: The [Kafka ecosystem](https://developer.confluent.io/learn/kraft/) uses the KRaft protocol, a variant of Raft, to manage metadata and replace the dependency on ZooKeeper. This simplifies Kafka's architecture and improves stability, scalability, and ease of management.

3. **Oracle**: [Oracle's Globally Distributed Database](https://blogs.oracle.com/database/post/raft-replication-in-distributed-23c) employs Raft for replicating data across shards. This ensures consistency and fault tolerance in distributed database environments, providing robust data management even in the presence of failures.

4. **IBM**: [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/IBM/raft-fabric-sample), an open-source blockchain framework developed by IBM, uses the Raft protocol for its ordering service, ensuring that transactions are ordered and committed correctly across the blockchain network.

These examples highlight Raft's versatility and reliability in various distributed systems, ensuring data consistency and fault tolerance across different applications and industries.

We choose to manually integrate with the raft protocol to provide a minimal framework and lightweight raft server with the context of AVS task generation, aggregation and submission.
